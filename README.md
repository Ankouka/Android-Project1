My app is request forum that asks users to input their personal information, the video game company they like, and concepts on the types of games they want to see. This app is more catered towards people who like video games and getting game designs. I feel some people rarely get voices heard when they speak to gaming developers about their concepts on a game, so I want this app to encourage people to share their ideas on their dreams to their favorite video game company.
The first fragment is welcome page and has a button that allows the user to go the second fragment page. The second fragment prompts the user to input their full name, email, and today's date.

The third fragment page prompts the user to input the gaming company they know and presents a list of well known game companies. After that the user clicks the button below to the fourth fragment page. The fourth fragment page prompts the user input their video game concepts and description of the game. After that the user clicks the submit button and they are done with forum.
